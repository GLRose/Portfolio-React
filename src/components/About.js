      <p>
        When I first learned to code I was hooked. I found web development and software development magical. 
        The fact that you can nearly do anything by typing a language that a computer can interpret is amazing. 
        Sure there is magic behind coding but the true source of that spark is problem solving.
        I take pride in developing fullstack web applications and I hope that I can solve more problems in a team of other passionate developers!
